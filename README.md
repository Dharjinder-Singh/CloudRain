# CloudRain
Thundering clouds and then..... there was rain.


To start the project. the cloud worker should be online. so contact me for that. Then you can run meetbot.js or zoomapp.js. (uncomment the line about joining the meet in zoom).

then audio will be recorded and the keypoints extracted will be stored in our D1 database. We are currently working on separting this stuff into apis so someone can use it easily.
